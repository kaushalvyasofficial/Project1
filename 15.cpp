/*Write a c++ program for below problem statement 
Tour operator organizes guided bus trips across the Maharashtra. Tourists may 
have different preferences. Tour operator offers a choice from many different 
routes. Every day the bus moves from starting city S to another city F as chosen 
by client. On this way, the tourists can see the sights alongside the route 
travelled from S to F. Client may have preference to choose route. There is a 
restriction on the routes that the tourists may choose from, the bus has to take 
a short route from S to F or a route having one distance unit longer than the 
minimal distance. Two routes from S to F are considered different if there is at 
least one road from a city A to a city B which is part of one route, but not of 
the other route.
